abstract = {A combined furnace and reactor calculation is performed for the simulation of the decoking of an ethane cracker with a steam/air mixture. Different gas-solid reaction/diffusion models with a corresponding texture model describing the solid phase changes during the decoking operation are combined with kinetics for the decoking by combustion and gasification, determined based on experimental data [Heynderickx, G.J., Schools, E.M., Marin, G.B., 2005. Coke combustion and gasification kinetics in ethane steam crackers. A.I.Ch.E. Journal 51 (5), 1414-1428]. By comparing the calculated coil outlet temperatures and the calculated partial pressures of carbon dioxide at the coil outlet with the measured values in an industrial unit, the need for a general gas-solid reaction/diffusion model and the corresponding decoking kinetics is confirmed. The decoking time for an industrial unit is simulated adequately. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Tjoa1991,
abstract = {This paper addresses the development of a new hybrid successive quadratic programming (SQP) method for solving nonlinear parameter estimation problems. Here, we show that the Hessian information for quadratically convergent algorithms can be constructed using only first derivatives for small residual problems. Furthermore, it has been combined with a tailored quasi-Newton update formula to deal with large residuals. Moreover, the properties of reduced spaces have been exploited to deal very efficiently with large-scale problems. These strategies have also been coupled to a large-scale modeling system (GAMS) which allows for the easy construction of complex process models. Here, a dynamic model is used to illustrate one of the possible applications of the method. The model is discretized by orthogonal collocation on finite elements. With this approach, both solution and optimization occur simultaneously, and constraints on the state variables can be imposed directly.},

abstract = {We express a general mixed-integer programming (MIP) scheduling model in state-space form, and show how common scheduling disruptions, which lead to rescheduling, can be modeled as disturbances in the state-space model. We also discuss how a wide range of scheduling models, with different types of decisions and processing constraints, can be expressed in state-space form. The proposed framework offers a natural representation of dynamic systems, thereby enabling researchers in the chemical process control area to study scheduling problems. It also facilitates the application of known results for hybrid systems, as well as the development of new tools necessary to address scheduling applications. We hope that it will lead to the development of scheduling solution methods with desired closed-loop properties, a topic that has received no attention in the process operations literature.},

@article{Sager2009,
abstract = {In model-based nonlinear optimal control switching decisions that can be optimized often play an important role. Prominent examples of such hybrid systems are gear switches for transport vehicles or on/off valves in chemical engineering. Optimization algorithms need to take the discrete nature of the variables that model these switching decisions into account. Unnecessarily, for many applications still an equidistant time discretization and either rounding or standard mixed-integer solvers are used. In this article we survey recent progress in theoretical bounds, reformulations, and algorithms for this problem class and show how process control can benefit from them. We propose a comprehensive algorithm based on the solution of a sequence of purely continuous problems and simulations, and provide a new and more compact proof for its well-posedness. Instead of focusing on a particular application, we classify different solution behaviors in the applications section. We provide references to respective case studies with prototype character and cite newly emerging benchmark libraries. We conclude by pointing out future challenges for process control with switching decisions. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The effectiveness factor problem for heat and mass transfer with chemical reaction in a catalyst pellet is solved with a new technique especially suited to situations corresponding to high Thiele modulus when the solution is confined to a thin boundary region near the catalyst surface. The method of orthogonal collocation on finite elements combines the rapid convergence of the orthogonal collocation method with the convenience associated with finite difference method of locating grid points or elements where the solution is important or has large gradients. The efficienct of the method results from block LU decompositions employed in the iterative schemes devised. The method is applied to two problems to illustrate the rate of convergence, the efficiency (as expressed by error versus computation time curves), and the use of the residual for optimum location of the finite elements. Comparisons are also made to usual orthogonal collocation and finite difference methods.},

abstract = {This paper extends some duality results from a standard optimization setup to a noncooperative (Nash) game framework. A Nash game (NG) with coupled constraints is considered. Solving directly such a coupled NG requires coordination among possibly all players. An alternative approach is proposed based on its relation to a special constrained optimization problem for the NG-game cost function, with respect to the second argument that admits a fixed-point solution. Specific separability properties of the NG-game cost are exploited and duality results are developed. This duality extension leads naturally to a hierarchical decomposition into a lower-level NG with no coupled constraints, and a higher-level system optimization problem. In the second part of the paper these theoretical results are applied to a coupled NG with coupled constraints as encountered in optical networks. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Customers make purchasing decisions sequentially under the nested logit model: they first select a nest of products and subsequently purchase one within the selected nest. We consider the multiproduct pricing problem under the general nested logit model with product-differentiated price sensitivities and arbitrary nest coefficients. We show that the adjusted markup, defined as price minus cost minus the reciprocal of price sensitivity, is constant for all the products within a nest at optimality. This reduces the problem's dimension to a single variable per nest. We also show that the adjusted nest-level markup is nest invariant for all the nests, which further reduces the problem to maximizing a single-variable unimodal function under mild conditions.

abstract = {This paper proposes a novel model predictive control (MPC) scheme based on multiobjective optimization. At each sampling time, the MPC control action is chosen among the set of Pareto optimal solutions based on a time-varying, state-dependent decision criterion. Compared to standard single-objective MPC formulations, such a criterion allows one to take into account several, often irreconcilable, control specifications, such as high bandwidth (closed-loop promptness) when the state vector is far away from the equilibrium and low bandwidth (good noise rejection properties) near the equilibrium. After recasting the optimization problem associated with the multiobjective MPC controller as a multiparametric multiobjective linear or quadratic program, we show that it is possible to compute each Pareto optimal solution as an explicit piecewise affine function of the state vector and of the vector of weights to be assigned to the different objectives in order to get that particular Pareto optimal solution. Furthermore, we provide conditions for selecting Pareto optimal solutions so that the MPC control loop is asymptotically stable, and show the effectiveness of the approach in simulation examples.},

The texture changes of the coke during the combustion and gasification are accounted for. Different kinetic models are combined with a coke porosity model and different gas-solid reaction/diffusion models. The model parameters are estimated from the experimental data and model discrimination is performed. For the coke combustion the kinetic model is based on the dissociative chemisorption of oxygen on the active coke sites, whereas a general gas-solid reaction/diffusion model is required. The growth of the pores and the overlap of the pores during the coke combustion are found to compensate each other. For the coke gasification, the kinetic mechanism is based on the dissociative chemisorption of steam, whereas a uniform gas-solid reaction/diffusion model is used.

abstract = {We propose a modeling framework for stable simulation of multi-phase reactor systems operating at thermodynamic equilibrium. The model framework can be used to determine system characteristics, explore parameter sensitivity and test control system strategies. The thermodynamic equilibrium assumption and the use of reaction invariants make it computationally inexpensive. We show that the feedback control approach based on the overall inventories of the system can be effectively used for improved performance of such reactor systems. Two multi-phase reactor systems - the vapor recovery reactor used in carbothermic aluminum reduction and the gasification reactor used in IGCC are considered to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed modeling and control approach. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A new methodology for the design of experiments is presented that provides a way to optimize the operation of a variety of batch and semibatch or fed-batch processes without the use of a knowledge-driven or fundamental model describing the inner workings of the process, when one or more time-varying decision variables must be selected. The types of processes that can benefit from this approach include those producing specialty chemical, pharmaceutical, or food products whose production rate is not high enough to justify the development of a knowledge-driven model. The approach generalizes the classical and widely used Design of Experiments (DoE), which considers only decision variables, or factors, which are constant with time. The new approach, called the Design of Dynamic Experiments (DoDE), systematically designs experiments that explore a considerable number of dynamic signatures, called dynamic subfactors (DSFs), in the time dependency of the unknown decision variables or factors.

@article{Zavala2009,
abstract = {Widespread application of dynamic optimization with fast optimization solvers leads to increased consideration of first-principles models for nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC). However, significant barriers to this optimization-based control strategy are feedback delays and consequent loss of performance and stability due to on-line computation. To overcome these barriers, recently proposed NMPC controllers based on nonlinear programming (NLP) sensitivity have reduced on-line computational costs and can lead to significantly improved performance. In this study, we extend this concept through a simple reformulation of the NMPC problem and propose the advanced-step NMPC controller. The main result of this extension is that the proposed controller enjoys the same nominal stability properties of the conventional NMPC controller without computational delay. In addition, we establish further robustness properties in a straightforward manner through input-to-state stability concepts. A case study example is presented to demonstrate the concepts. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},
